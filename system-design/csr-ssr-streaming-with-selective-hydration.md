# CSR, SSR, Streaming with Selective Hydration

## üü¢ First: What does **Hydration** mean?

When you get HTML from SSR or Streaming:

* The **HTML already looks correct** (you see text, images, etc.).
* But it‚Äôs just **static HTML** ‚Üí buttons, dropdowns, forms don‚Äôt work.
* React (or any framework) must **attach JavaScript event listeners** (click, hover, submit) to the DOM.

üëâ This process is called **hydration** = ‚Äútaking static HTML and making it alive/interactive with JS.‚Äù

**Mini Story:** Think of SSR HTML as a **toy robot in a shop window**. It looks real, but doesn‚Äôt move. Hydration is when you put **batteries inside** ‚Üí now the robot walks and talks

***

### 1. **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**

> üëâ Render everything **on the browser** after downloading a JavaScript bundle.

#### How it works

1. Browser loads an empty/**blank HTML** (`<div id="root"></div>`)
2. Downloads JavaScript bundle (React Code `main.js`)&#x20;
3. JS (React) executes ‚Üí builds the DOM for product title, price, and button.
4. User sees the page after everything loads.

üî¥ User waits ‚Üí bad for SEO.

#### Pros

* Rich interactivity.
* Easy to scale since the server just serves static files (CDN-friendly).
* Good for apps that are heavily **stateful** (dashboards, Gmail, Figma).

#### Cons

* **Slow First Paint** (white screen until JS arrives and runs).
* SEO suffers (search engine crawlers might not wait for hydration).

#### Story Example üè™

Imagine visiting a **restaurant** where:

* You walk in ‚Üí all tables are empty, no menus.
* Waiter says: ‚ÄúHold on, I‚Äôll bring everything.‚Äù
* After some time, the waiter brings the table, chairs, food, and cutlery **all at once**.
* That‚Äôs CSR ‚Üí **blank page until JavaScript sets up everything.**

### 2. **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**

> üëâ Render HTML on the server, send a fully built page ‚Üí browser just displays.

#### How it works

1. The browser requests the product page.
2. Server runs React ‚Üí generates HTML string with product title, price, ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù button.
3. Sends ready HTML to the browser.
4. The browser immediately shows product info (static).
5. Later, React JS hydrates ‚Üí button becomes clickable.

üü¢ Fast to see content, but hydration still takes time.

#### Pros

* **Fast First Paint** ‚Üí better UX & SEO.
* Good for content-heavy pages (blogs, e-commerce, landing pages).

#### Cons

* Server CPU cost (rendering HTML repeatedly).
* Slower for user interactions (extra hydration step).

#### Story Example üçî

Imagine visiting **McDonald‚Äôs**:

* You order a burger.
* The kitchen prepares it **before you sit down**.
* You instantly get a **ready-to-eat burger**.
* That‚Äôs SSR ‚Üí server does the work, you just eat.

***

### 3. **Streaming (SSR with Streaming)**

> üëâ Server doesn‚Äôt wait to generate the **entire HTML**. It sends HTML **in chunks** as soon as ready.

#### How it works

1. The browser requests the product page.
2. The server first sends skeleton: Header + placeholder for product.
3. The browser shows the **header instantly**.
4. Server fetches price, reviews, and streams them one by one ‚Üí browser updates.
5. The browser shows content progressively.

üü¢ Feels fast, even when data is slow.

In Summary :&#x20;

* Problem it solves: **Slow server responses** (e.g., some data takes longer to fetch).
* Approach: Send HTML **piece by piece** instead of waiting for all.
* Benefit: User **sees content earlier** (progressive render).

#### Pros

* Ultra-fast initial render (users see skeleton instantly).
* Better perceived performance.
* Works well with **slow APIs** or big pages (news feeds, search results).

#### Cons

* Harder to implement/debug.
* Needs modern infra (HTTP/2, React 18+ streaming).

#### Story Example üì∫

Imagine Netflix:

* You open a movie page.
* First, you see the **movie title + poster**.
* Then, **synopsis loads**, then **reviews**, then **similar movies**.
* That‚Äôs Streaming ‚Üí server streams chunks instead of waiting for all.
* All is still static HTML until hydration.

***

### 4. **Selective Hydration** (React 18+ feature)

> üëâ Instead of hydrating the **entire HTML at once**, only hydrate interactive parts **on demand**.

#### How it works

* Server sends fully rendered HTML (SSR or streaming).
* The browser shows a static page instantly.
* React hydrates **only important widgets first** (e.g., navbar, search box).
* Other parts (like the footer, carousels) hydrate **later**.

In Summary :&#x20;

* Problem it solves: **Slow interactivity** when the page has many components.
* Approach: Hydrate **important parts first** (e.g., ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button) ‚Üí make interactive earlier, while other parts hydrate later.
* Benefit: The User can **interact earlier**, even if the page is huge.

#### Pros

* Faster interaction for critical UI (search, login button).
* Saves CPU & battery (especially on mobile).
* Great for big apps with many components.

#### Cons

* Needs careful planning, which components hydrate first?
* Not supported by all frameworks yet.

#### Story Example üé¢

Think of **Disneyland**:

* Park opens at 9 AM.
* Not all rides open instantly.
* **Main rides (roller coasters, Ferris wheel)** open first ‚Üí people start enjoying.
* Later, smaller rides (tea cups, mini-games) open gradually.\
  That‚Äôs Selective Hydration ‚Üí **critical UI works first, rest catches up later**.

| **Initial HTML**                  | Empty `<div id="root"></div>` | Fully built HTML             | Partial HTML (sent in chunks)            | Fully built HTML (same as SSR/Streaming)             |
| **Who Builds UI?**                | Browser (JS runs)             | Server                       | Server (but streams gradually)           | Server (same as SSR/Streaming)                       |

| **When Page Becomes Interactive** | After hydration of whole app  | After hydration of whole app | After hydration of whole app             | Parts hydrate **on priority** (critical parts first) |

## ‚úÖ Wrap-Up Analogy

* **CSR** = Restaurant gives you **raw ingredients** ‚Üí you cook on your table. (slow start, fun later)
* **SSR** = The Restaurant serves you a **fully cooked meal**. (fast start, but the kitchen is busy)
* **Streaming** = They serve **starter ‚Üí main course ‚Üí dessert** as they‚Äôre ready. (progressive experience)
* **Selective Hydration** = They serve **main dishes first**, smaller sides later. (critical first, rest later)
